<h2>Learnings about Systemd for mounting EBS volumes</h2>

<p>Recently I needed to learn more about <code>systemd</code>. The man-pages
are great, but here are a few semi-surprising points.

<h3>Mounting disks</h3>

<p>The entries in <code>/etc/fstab</code> are dynamically converted to <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.mount.html">systemd
  mount units</a>, and mounting is managed by systemd. After changing
fstab, you can invoke <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> to regenerate the
dynamic config, and <code>systemctl list-units --type=mount</code> to list the mount units. Try the latter now.

<p>This means other units can depend on mounts being ready, using the
<code>RequiresMountsFor</code> <a
href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html">unit
directive</a>.

<p>Even though an fstab entry and a hand-written mount unit is supposed to be
equal, fstab is more equal - there are certain magic fstab options that don't
(yet) have a hand-written mount unit counterpart. Specifically,
<code>x-systemd.device-timeout=</code> lets you specify how long the mount unit
should wait for the device to appear. Also, <b><code>x-systemd.makefs</code> will
  format the disk if it doesn't yet contain a filesystem</b>, which is handy when
creating nodes and disks automatically. Therefore using fstab is superior to
hand-written mount units.

<p>Sidenote: <code>cloud-init</code>'s <code>mounts</code> module is not a good
way to write fstab entries, if the devices attach to the instance later - since
cloud-init will check if the device exists, and if not, omits adding the fstab
entry. Rather, use <code>bootcmd</code> to write the fstab entries manually.

<p>Which device name to use? When attaching multiple EBS volumes, the
device name (<code>/dev/nvme...</code>) doesn't hint about the identity of the
device. But you can use the <code>/dev/disk/by-id/....volXXX</code> stable
identifier based on the EBS volume id.

<h3>Chained loading</h3>

<p>There are orthogonal but interrelated concepts of startup ordering between
units (<code>Before/After</code>) and dependencies between units
  (<code>Wants/Requires/...</code>).  You can inspect unit dependencies by
  issuing <code>systemd-analyze dot the-unit</code>, which will output the
  ordering and dependency relations in graphviz format.

<p>Dependencies control what other units a given unit will pull in to the
activation set (transaction), if the given unit is to be activated itself.
But it doesn't impose ordering.

<p>Ordering relations take effect <b>only if both units are activated in the
  same transaction</b>. They are attempted to be activated in the same
transaction, if they are both transitively pulled in by a top-level unit to be
activated. But most often, they will be direct dependencies.

<p>What about restarts and dependencies? I would have naively assumed that a
restart happens in response to a failure, but there was no mention in the
systemd docs that after a successful restart of a failed unit, its reverse
dependencies would be restarted as well. As far I understand now, <b>I was
wrong</b>.  In systemd terminology, restarts don't yet cause a unit to fail.
Only exhausting the restart limit will transition the unit to a
<code>failed</code> state. There are no automatic attempts to recover from the
failed state.

<h3>What is multi-user.target anyway?</h3>

<p>So what determines the set of units to start up during boot? The pseudo-target <code>multi-user.target</code>'s dependencies.
This is why you often see a reverse-dependency
<code>WantedBy=multi-user.target</code> in the <code>Install</code> section.

<p>What is the <code>Install</code> section, by the way? The reverse dependencies
listed there only get added, if you enable a unit using <code>systemctl enable the-unit</code> (enabling actually just adds a symlink).
So a unit can declare a reverse-dependency on multi-user.target - that is, the potential to be auto-started during boot -,
but users can actually control if they want the auto-start to happen.

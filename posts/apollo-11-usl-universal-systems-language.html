            <h2>Apollo 11, LGC and Universal Systems Language</h2>

            <p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11</a> and got curious about
the guidance computer (LGC). Turns out sources are available at
<a href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/tree/master/Luminary099">https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/tree/master/Luminary099</a>.</p>
<p>The software was implemented by a team of 300+ programmers lead by
Margaret Hamilton, a great effort. She also received an award recently
in recognition of her work - having apparently coined the term “software
engineering”, and driving formalism and best practices into a until-then
wild-west approach. Some feats of their work that captured my
imagination include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Treating the humans as part of the system, and accounting for
possible human error.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing LGC in some mix of higher-level interpreted and a
low-level assembly. Interpreted was slower, but was more feature rich
and took less ROM space, which was crucial at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>The runtime having some kind of task priority system that could
shed unimportant tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>The runtime having some checkpointing system to be able to
recover from errors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia also pointed that Hamilton created various businesses to
further refine their ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance. I
thought I found some secret goldmine of knowledge, and was eager to find
out what they were up to.</p>
<p>The ideas were implemented in methodologies called Higher Order
Software (HOS), or later Universal Systems Language (USL). The main
materials I used for research are:</p>

<p>The promotional message that captured my imagination is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Universal Systems Language (USL) is based on a preventive,
development-before-the-fact philosophy that does not allow errors in, in
the first place. USL has evolved over several decades, offering system
engineers and software developers a language they can use to solve
problems previously considered next to impossible to solve with
traditional approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a modern perspective, when hearing above, I would have though
about: a set of clear best-practices, usage of formal methods, strong
type systems, robustness checking with QuickCheck, TLA+…</p>
<p>Turns out, you need to rewind to 1969 to interpret it. For example,
Hamilton saw people hardcode relative data field offsets at the
use-sites when accessing data structures defined in foreign modules,
leading to all kinds of now-expectable coupling and out-of-sync bugs.
She realized that as a problem, and proposed accessing data only via an
API, which is accessed by name, not by hardcoded offsets (that is,
calling named labels in the assembler instead of hardcoding).</p>
<p>Translating to contemporary terms, if I had to promote USL, this is
what I would write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A (pure?) functional language with compile-time type checking, that
comes with a GUI, a set of battle-tested avionics libraries (?), and
compiler backends able to target 1970’s era systems (?). It also has a
runtime which supports fixed priority based scheduling of lightweight
threads (?).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This more modest presentation might not draw much attention nowadays,
but might still appeal to people who need to work in that avionics niche
today - is that tech still alive? The idea to put a functional (note,
Dijkstra means that under “applicative”) language to production at the
time could have been radical.</p>
<p>What is particularly sad, that this system might have been
revolutionary in its time, but keeping presenting it as still
revolutinary today gives false hopes to interested people.</p>
<h2 id="random-details">Random details</h2>
<p>Some thoughts I noted while reading about HOS/USL. First, HOS
advertises that once you wrote your data types and functions well, you
can reuse them infinitely, giving loads of productivity boost. But the
modern realization is that as domains get larger, an initially adequate,
shared representation and logic starts to no longer fit it. What
initially seemed like a single concept, turns out to mean slightly
different things to different components. Thus domains should be
isolated and kept mostly independent, raising a barrier to reuse. See
Domain Driven Design.</p>
<p>HOS mentions the code written is “provably correct”. Naturally such
an universal statement raises hairs in programmers. But I remember
myself being fascinated by the Curry-Howard correspondence (often quoted
by Haskell people), which relates logics to type systems - provability
in the logic corresponds to being able to construct a program that
type-checks in the related type system. So you can’t really blame HOS
for using that argument some 20 years in advance. Even if “typechecks”
is not really the same as “provably correct”.</p>
<h3 id="the-navy-review-paper">The navy review paper</h3>
<p>The paper concludes there’s no silver bullet, and HOS still needs
tedious programming. Which might have been amplified by having to edit
in a tree-based GUI? Interestingly, even the navy review paper mentions
it is not concievable that a non-GUI editor could exist for this system.
Why? Was there some GUI kool-aid permeating everything in the 1980’s?
Why would a simple functional language not be edited as text?</p>
<p>The paper also mentions that the primitives in HOS are leaky, and in
practice one still needs to think about implications on the target
architectures. For example, the integer type in HOS would compile to the
targets native integer, causing problems due to difference in overflow
behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>imperfections creep into the methodology and proliferate the
theoretical beauty</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems HOS was functional, but didn’t support passing a function as
an argument, or defining lambda expressions. Which made
higher-order-functions hard/impossible? Would be quite a pun that Higher
Order Software doesn’t support higher order functions.</p>
<p>Performance issues are mentioned stemming from the functional
approach. For example, matrix multiplication cites the need of creating
many intermediate matrices. It is fun how for example even today, GHC -
the state of the art Haskell compiler - needs layers of black magic (ST
monad, rewrite rules, optimization phases) to enable competitive
performance. I can feel the pain of the HOS implementers and their
boldness to go forward nevertheless.</p>
<h3 id="slide-notes">Slide notes</h3>
<p>The USL slides found are pretty hectic. The GUI-first approach to development
seems to reflect on the slides - AST-like structures are laid out as a
tree, making them indeed seem hierarchical, but hard to comprehend.
Standard text-based representation of functions would be more
accessible?</p>
<p>The language doesn’t seem to have sum types (aka enums on steroids).
This maybe makes the <code>or</code> construct more error-prone than
what could be represented with sum types. Well, that’s true for most of
the programming languages until recently.</p>

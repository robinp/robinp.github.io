<p>Now that we have our <a href="../../posts/en/24days-of-infra-day-1-version-control.html">sources under version control</a>, we should embark on actually building it. A build tool spares us remembering the actual sequence of commands to complete the build, while also taking care not to compile in unchanged dependencies in vain.</p>
<p>Traditionally developers had the luxury to work with a single language (say Java or C) and use a de-facto build system of that language (say maven or CMake). If we develop a relatively isolated feature, we might just be able to get away with that.</p>
<p>But if we are building a moderately sized system, chances are that we can’t be very picky, and have to use the components already around, regardless of the language they are written in. A piece of Scala here, bits of Haskell there, eventually calling a native library written in C++…</p>
<p>Therefore the build system should be able to manage building a range of languages, as well as managing inter-language dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="why-would-i-want-to-build-those">Why would I want to build those?</h3>
<p>Forgetting about calling native code, let’s assume that we only write and build a single language, and use third party components written in other languages. Why would we want to be able to build those components instead of just using them as binaries?</p>
<p>Again, we might just get away without. But if you ever depended on a third-party library, you possibly had to hunt down a peculiar bug in its source and patch it. Struggle half a day to compile it. Then hack the build files to make them use the locally patched version, sitting tight waiting for the upstream maintainers to merge the patch you sent them and eventually release it.</p>
<p>Now, would you be happy investigating how to compile, while all your services are down due to a bug in one such dependency and customers coming with pitchforks?</p>
<p>Facebook or Google certainly wouldn’t, that’s why they have all their sources in a giant source tree <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="and-what-about-transitive-dependencies">And what about transitive dependencies?</h3>
<p>Yes, those libraries tend to have enourmous dependencies, which also have to be imported to the source tree.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, if you add all third party libraries to a distinct location, it is easier to verify that all their licenses conform to your usage <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Watch Google’s Chris DiBona <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=yeDWV7PSbgQ">explain open source strategies</a> in this video.</p>
<h3 id="so-are-there-such-build-tools">So are there such build tools?</h3>
<p>If you are adventourus enough, can write you own build tool based on <a href="http://shakebuild.com">Shake</a>. Otherwise keep an eye on <a href="http://pantsbuild.github.io/index.html">Pants</a> from Twitter and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/buck/">Buck</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> from Facebook. Google’s build tool can even utilize the hermetic nature of builds to perform <a href="http://google-engtools.blogspot.ch/2011/09/build-in-cloud-distributing-build-steps.html">parallel builds in the cloud</a>.</p>

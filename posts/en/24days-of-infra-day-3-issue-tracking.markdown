After [version control][1] and [build systems][2], we hit the lighter topic of keeping
list of bugs and feature requests.
Please excuse me for the slightly relaxed tone, take what I write here with
a grain of salt.

This should not be hard, really.
In less agile times we probably used [bugzilla][3] or [trac][4], searched for
an already submitted issue based on keywords or open a new one, updated it with
progress from time to time and finally closed it.

### #pun begin

With new winds came the widespread use of agile boards, either physical or
online, or often both in parallel. Their benefit is that they visualize the
various stages of developing a feature / fixing a bug, and initially making
the development faster by applying social pressure on developers. Anyone
who is not able to move any of his tasks forward on the board at the daily
standup meeting has to either blame someone for blocking him, apologize or
hide in a corner.

The initial boost of progress quickly gets detoriated as developers realize,
that they have to synchronize the online board with the physical one and spend
hours on this.

To address this shortcoming, other elements of the agile
process grant developers undisturbed prime time to focus on their work.
This is possible since the agile process guarantees, that once the tasks are
selected for a weekly cycle, they can't be modified during the week - except
under rare circumstances like when someone found a bug, or forgot to
include a task (but only if the task is very small).

All in all, four out of five developers will admit that agile works well,
_if done properly_.

### #pun end

Puns aside, I quite enjoy working with [Trello][5] lately.
Homework: open-source solution to integrate with Github issues.

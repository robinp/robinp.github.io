<p>Inspired by <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/">24 Days of Hackage</a>, this is a post series about (a biased selection of) software infrastructure components found in modern development and serving environment.</p>
<p>We start with development related components like versioning, building and releasing, then move to production components like queues, storage and analysis support. Our first topic is version control (aka source control).</p>
<p>Hopefully it is no surprise that the first thing a developer wants to do when starting a new project is to put code under version control (if it is a surprise, execute <code>git init</code> before it would be too late). Code additions and modifications thus happen in logical units containing a set of related changes, called commits. Code is checkpointed after each commit, so any given state can be restored later.</p>
<p>As opposed to copying sources to a backup periodically, version control lets us track who changed what on a line by line basis. And if we are lucky, the commit messages also tell us why. It really is a baseline for multi-, or even single-developer settings.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-version">What to version?</h3>
<p>Not only source code can be versioned, but any files in general. It would be frustrating to be able to restore source code to a previous state, but not the accompanying config files, wouldn’t it? Therefore it makes sense to put configuration files under source control, too <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>So at this point we can roll the source and configurations back to a given point in time. But what about compiling the source? Imagine that we roll back to a year old version, and the source at that point used a language feature that got deprecated in the meantime - the current compiler on the build machine already rejects the source. Multiply this with the number of tools we depend on, and we have a serious problem. To avoid such issues, companies like Facebook or Google also keep all the tooling needed to compile the sources under version control.</p>
<h3 id="wait-even-binaries">Wait! Even binaries?</h3>
<p>Yes. When we roll back, we also get the tools to build with at that point. This is called a hermetic build.</p>
<p>If we are really keen and intend to patch the compiler every now and then, can go deeper and check in sources for the compiler and tools, then make sure the checked-in binary is the one resulting from compiling those sources.</p>
<h3 id="stop-now.">Stop, now.</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s take a step back. For smaller companies or startups this is quite an overhead on the short term. You are free to evaluate if the benefits are significant enough for your use-case.</p>
<p>An alternative to checking in tooling is to have them in a versioned repository, and have the build scripts point to the appropriate version. Can you spot any drawbacks of this scheme?</p>
